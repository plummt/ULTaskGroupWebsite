  UL Circadian Recomended Practices Task Group</h1>
</div>
<div class="mid" id="mid">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>As society moves  further from using the sun as our major source of lighting, and there for the  driver for syncing to a 24 hour day, (where we wake up around sunrise and go to  sleep soon after sun set), and more reliant on electric lighting as our source  of lighting, where there is major goal is to provide lighting for a task, but  little to no consideration for maintaining a 24 hour day. Studies have shown  that if the internal circadian rhythm is misaligned from their wake\sleep  schedule a myriad of health problems start arising, from increase in obesity  rates, heart rate abnormalities, increase in depression, and many others. Additionally,  there may be social requirements that can cause a person to purposefully desync  their light/dark cycle from their sleep wake cycle, these requirements (such as  job requirements, or school, or leisure) can increase these effects.&nbsp;It  then becomes necessary for lighting fixtures to have Recommended Practices for  which fixtures are capable of assisting people to maintain their sleep/wake  cycle and light/dark cycle, i.e. entrainment.</p>
  <p>This task group  consisting of various members from Underwriters Laboratories, the Lighting  Research Center, and key persons in the industry, will work to develop these  Recommended Practices, and provide resources for developing fixtures that meet  these Recommended Practices. These Recommended Practices will work to broaden  the industry understating the science of circadian entrainment, through the  lens of the research conducted at the LRC and other laboratories and developing  guidelines for different applications.</p>
